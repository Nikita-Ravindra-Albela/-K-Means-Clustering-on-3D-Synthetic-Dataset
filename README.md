# -K-Means-Clustering-on-3D-Synthetic-Dataset
This project showcases how to apply K-Means Clustering on a 3-dimensional synthetic dataset, generated using sklearn.datasets.make_blobs(). The goal is to visualize and understand the behavior of clustering in higher-dimensional space using unsupervised learning.
